	<h1>Project 1: Weather App</h1>
        <h2>Description: This program randomly generates the weather and provides a drawing based off if conditions are snowy, rainy, or sunny. The app asks for the user's guess on the day's current weather conditions, then lets you know if that guess was correct. It then will display the current weather conditions in a drawing and show you the temperature, humidity, and wind speeds.</h2>

<h1>Project 2: Duck Hunt</h1>
        <h2>Description: We have chosen to create a Duck Hunt game where the user must click on ducks to capture them and score as many points as possible. The ducks will be moving around and attempting to make their capture more difficult for the player as the game progresses. This will require using functions, loops, manipulative strings, and list indexing.</h2>
